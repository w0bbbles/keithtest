Basic Rules and Objectives:

Using trial and error, explore the different ingredients available that will produce different meals before you cook a recipe for disaster!

Modes:

Single Player

Only using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript

Approach Taken:

I started by laying out boxes on my HTML page to figure out what needed to be where on screen for a visual reference before I started writing the game. I proceeded to search up all relevant images required to fill up my div boxes while I fill up the empty blanks in my Javascript. After doing so, was a list of arrays to match all ingredient combinations to their respective meals. And lastly to produce a pop up sign to show the user what they would have created with their chosen ingredients.

Unsolved Problems:

The game was designed so that the user would received a set number of hearts to fill up a heart meter bar with all the different variation of meals the user could prepare before the user stumbles onto certain set combination that would end the game. It was unfortunately not completed to that extent due to much troubleshooting and figuring out how each syntax would form a line of code which proved time consuming and not a favourable outcome in the end.
